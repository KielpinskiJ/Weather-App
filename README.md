# Weather App Project

This user-friendly Weather App was built with HTML, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mM1UIenRhK808W8qmLWv) was to build an application to complete the given user stories. The app connects with the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API to fetch and display weather data for any city searched by the user. It displays today's weather as well as the forecast for the next five days. The app also provides additional information such as wind speed and direction, humidity, visibility, and air pressure.
